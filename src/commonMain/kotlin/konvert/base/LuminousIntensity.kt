/**
 * In photometry, luminous intensity is a measure of the wavelength-weighted power emitted
 * by a light source in a particular direction per unit solid angle, based on the luminosity
 * function, a standardized model of the sensitivity of the human eye. The SI unit of
 * luminous intensity is the candela (cd), an SI base unit.
 *
 * Photometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. The
 * human eye can only see light in the visible spectrum and has different sensitivities to
 * light of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions
 * (photopic vision), the eye is most sensitive to greenish-yellow light at 555 nm. Light
 * with the same radiant intensity at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity.
 * The curve which measures the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard,
 * known as the luminosity function. This curve, denoted V(Î»), is based on an average of
 * widely differing experimental data from scientists using different measurement techniques.
 *
