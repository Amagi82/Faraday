/**
 * In geometry, a solid angle (symbol: Î©) is a measure of the amount of the field of view from some particular
 * point that a given object covers. That is, it is a measure of how large the object appears to an observer
 * looking from that point. The point from which the object is viewed is called the apex of the solid angle,
 * and the object is said to subtend its solid angle from that point.
 *
 * In the International System of Units (SI), a solid angle is expressed in a dimensionless unit called a
 * steradian (symbol: sr). One steradian corresponds to one unit of area on the unit sphere surrounding the
 * apex, so an object that blocks all rays from the apex would cover a number of steradians equal to the total
 * surface area of the unit sphere, 4*pi. Solid angles can also be measured in squares of angular measures
 * such as degrees, minutes, and seconds.
 *
 * A small object nearby may subtend the same solid angle as a larger object farther away. For example,
 * although the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, it is also much closer to Earth. Indeed, as viewed from
 * any point on Earth, both objects have approximately the same solid angle as well as apparent size. This
 * is evident during a solar eclipse.
 *
 * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle
