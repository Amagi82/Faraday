/**
 * Torque is the rotational equivalent of linear force. It is also referred to as the moment,
 * moment of force, rotational force or turning effect, depending on the field of study. The
 * concept originated with the studies by Archimedes of the usage of levers. Just as a linear
 * force is a push or a pull, a torque can be thought of as a twist to an object around a
 * specific axis. Another definition of torque is the product of the magnitude of the force
 * and the perpendicular distance of the line of action of force from the axis of rotation.
 * The symbol for torque is typically Ï„, the lowercase Greek letter tau. When being referred
 * to as moment of force, it is commonly denoted by M.
