/**
 * Length is a measure of distance. In the International System of Quantities, length is a
 * quantity with dimension distance. In most systems of measurement a base unit for length
 * is chosen, from which all other units are derived. In the International System of Units
 * (SI) system the base unit for length is the meter.
 *
 * Length is commonly understood to mean the most extended dimension of a fixed object.
 * However, this is not always the case and may depend on the position the object is in.
 *
 * Various terms for the length of a fixed object are used, and these include height, which
 * is vertical length or vertical extent, and width, breadth or depth. Height is used when
 * there is a base from which vertical measurements can be taken. Width or breadth usually
 * refer to a shorter dimension when length is the longest one. Depth is used for the third
 * dimension of a three dimensional object.
