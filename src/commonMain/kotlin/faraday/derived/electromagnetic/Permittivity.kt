/**
 * In electromagnetism, the absolute permittivity, often simply called permittivity and denoted by the
 * Greek letter Îµ (epsilon), is a measure of the electric polarizability of a dielectric. A material
 * with high permittivity polarizes more in response to an applied electric field than a material with
 * low permittivity, thereby storing more energy in the material. In electrostatics, the permittivity
 * plays an important role in determining the capacitance of a capacitor.
