/**
 * In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of the resistance of a material against the
 * formation of a magnetic field, otherwise known as distributed inductance in transmission line
 * theory. Hence, it is the degree of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an
 * applied magnetic field. Magnetic permeability is typically represented by the (italicized)
 * Greek letter Î¼. The term was coined in September 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. The reciprocal
 * of magnetic permeability is magnetic reluctivity.
