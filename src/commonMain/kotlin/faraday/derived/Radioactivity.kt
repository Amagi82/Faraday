/**
 * Specific activity is the activity per quantity of a radionuclide and is a physical property
 * of that radionuclide.
 *
 * Activity is a quantity related to radioactivity, for which the SI unit is the becquerel
 * (Bq), equal to one reciprocal second. The becquerel is defined as the number of radioactive
 * transformations per second that occur in a particular radionuclide. The older, non-SI unit
 * of activity is the curie (Ci), which is 3.7Ã—1010 transformations per second.
 *
 * Since the probability of radioactive decay for a given radionuclide is a fixed physical
 * quantity (with some slight exceptions, see changing decay rates), the number of decays that
 * occur in a given time of a specific number of atoms of that radionuclide is also a fixed
 * physical quantity (if there are large enough numbers of atoms to ignore statistical
 * fluctuations).
 *
 * Thus, specific activity is defined as the activity per quantity of atoms of a particular
 * radionuclide. It is usually given in units of Bq/g, but another commonly used unit of
 * activity is the curie (Ci) allowing the definition of specific activity in Ci/g. The amount
 * of specific activity should not be confused with level of exposure to ionizing radiation
 * and thus the exposure or absorbed dose. The absorbed dose is the quantity important in
 * assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on humans.
