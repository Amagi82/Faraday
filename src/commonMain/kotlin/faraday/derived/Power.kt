/**
 * In physics, power is the amount of energy transferred or converted per unit time. In the International
 * System of Units, the unit of power is the watt, equal to one joule per second. In older works, power
 * is sometimes called activity. Power is a scalar quantity.
 *
 * The output power of a motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular
 * velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the
 * traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The power of a jet-propelled vehicle is
 * the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb
 * converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in wattsâ€”the electrical energy used per
 * unit time.
 *
 * Electric power is the rate, per unit time, at which electrical energy is transferred by an electric
 * circuit. The SI unit of power is the watt, one joule per second.
