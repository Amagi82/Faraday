/**
 * The magnetic field can be defined in several equivalent ways based on the effects it has on its environment.
 *
 * Often the magnetic field is defined by the force it exerts on a moving charged particle. Experiments in
 * electrostatics show that a particle of charge q in an electric field E experiences a force F = qE. Other
 * experiments show that a charged particle experiences a force proportional to its relative velocity to a
 * current-carrying wire. The velocity dependent portion can be separated such that the force on the particle
 * satisfies the Lorentz force law,
 * F=q(E+v*B).
 * Here v is the particle's velocity and × denotes the cross product. The vector B is termed the magnetic field,
 * and it is defined as the vector field necessary to make the Lorentz force law correctly describe the motion
 * of a charged particle. This definition allows the determination of B in the following way:
 *
 * The command, "Measure the direction and magnitude of the vector B at such and such a place," calls for the
 * following operations: Take a particle of known charge q. Measure the force on q at rest, to determine E.
 * Then measure the force on the particle when its velocity is v; repeat with v in some other direction. Now
 * find a B that makes the Lorentz force law fit all these results—that is the magnetic field at the place in
 * question.
 *
 * Alternatively, the magnetic field can be defined in terms of the torque it produces on a magnetic dipole.
 *
 * In addition to B, there is a quantity H, which is often called the magnetic field. In a vacuum, B and H are
 * proportional to each other, with the multiplicative constant depending on the physical  Inside a
 * material they are different (see H and B inside and outside magnetic materials). The term "magnetic field"
 * is historically reserved for H while using other terms for B. Informally, though, and formally for some
 * recent textbooks mostly in physics, the term 'magnetic field' is used to describe B as well as or in place
 * of H. There are many alternative names for both.
 *
 * In SI units, B is measured in teslas (symbol: T) and correspondingly ΦB (magnetic flux) is measured in
 * webers (symbol: Wb) so that a flux density of 1 Wb/m2 is 1 tesla. The SI unit of tesla is equivalent to
 * (newton·second)/(coulomb·metre). In Gaussian-cgs units, B is measured in gauss (symbol: G). (The conversion
 * is 1 T = 10000 G.) One nanotesla is equivalent to 1 gamma (symbol: γ). The H-field is measured in amperes
 * per metre (A/m) in SI units, and in oersteds (Oe) in cgs
