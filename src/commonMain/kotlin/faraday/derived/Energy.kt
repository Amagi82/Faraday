/**
 * In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to
 * perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation
 * of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit
 * of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a
 * distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.
 *
 * Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored
 * by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy
 * stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant
 * energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.
 *
 * Mass and energy are closely related. Due to massâ€“energy equivalence, any object that has mass when
 * stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest
 * energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will
 * increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating
 * an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive
 * enough scale.
