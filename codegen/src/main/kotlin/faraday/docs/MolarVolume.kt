/**
 * The molar volume is the volume occupied divided by the amount of substance (of a chemical element
 * or chemical compound) at a given temperature and pressure. It is equal to the molar mass (M)
 * divided by the mass density (œÅ). It has the SI unit cubic metres per mole (m3/mol), although it
 * is typically more practical to use the units cubic decimetres per mole (dm3/mol) for gases and
 * cubic centimetres per mole (cm3/mol) for liquids and solids.
