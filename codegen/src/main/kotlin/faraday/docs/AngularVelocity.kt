/**
 * In physics, angular velocity refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative
 * to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes
 * with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin
 * angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with
 * respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point
 * object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular
 * position relative to the origin. Spin angular velocity is independent of the choice of
 * origin, in contrast to orbital angular velocity which depends on the choice of origin.
