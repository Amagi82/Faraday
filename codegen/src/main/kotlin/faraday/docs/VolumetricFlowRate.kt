/**
 * In physics and engineering, in particular fluid dynamics and hydrometry, the volumetric flow rate
 * (also known as volume flow rate, rate of fluid flow, Discharge (hydrology) or volume velocity) is
 * the volume of fluid which passes per unit time; usually represented by the symbol Q (sometimes VÌ‡).
 * The SI unit is cubic metres per second (m3/s).
