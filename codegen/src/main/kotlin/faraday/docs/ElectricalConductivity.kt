/**
 * Electrical conductivity or specific conductance is the reciprocal of electrical resistivity.
 * It represents a material's ability to conduct electric current. It is commonly signified by
 * the Greek letter σ (sigma), but κ (kappa) (especially in electrical engineering) and γ
 * (gamma) are sometimes used.
