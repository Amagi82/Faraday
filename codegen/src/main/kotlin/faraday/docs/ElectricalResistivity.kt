/**
 * Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity) and its
 * inverse, electrical conductivity, is a fundamental property of a material that quantifies how
 * strongly it resists or conducts electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that
 * readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho).
 * The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m). For example, if a 1m × 1m × 1m
 * solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these
 * contacts is 1Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1 Ω⋅m.
