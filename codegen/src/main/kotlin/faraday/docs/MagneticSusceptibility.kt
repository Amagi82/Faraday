/**
 * In electromagnetism, the magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how much a material will become
 * magnetized in an applied magnetic field. It is the ratio of magnetization M (magnetic moment per
 * unit volume) to the applied magnetizing field intensity H. This allows a simple classification,
 * into two categories, of most materials' responses to an applied magnetic field: an alignment with
 * the magnetic field, χ > 0, called paramagnetism, or an alignment against the field, χ < 0, called
 * diamagnetism.
