/**
 * Temperature is a physical property of matter that quantitatively expresses hot and cold. It
 * is the manifestation of thermal energy, present in all matter, which is the source of the
 * occurrence of heat, a flow of energy, when a body is in contact with another that is colder.
 *
 * Temperature is measured with a thermometer. Thermometers are calibrated in various temperature
 * scales that historically have used various reference points and thermometric substances for
 * definition. The most common scales are the Celsius scale (formerly called centigrade, denoted
 * °C), the Fahrenheit scale (denoted °F), and the Kelvin scale (denoted K), the last of which
 * is predominantly used for scientific purposes by conventions of the International System of
 * Units (SI).
