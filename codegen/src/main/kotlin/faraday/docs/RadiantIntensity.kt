/**
 * In radiometry, radiant intensity is the radiant flux emitted, reflected, transmitted or received,
 * per unit solid angle. Radiant intensity is distinct from irradiance and radiant exitance, which
 * are often called intensity in branches of physics other than radiometry. In radio-frequency
 * engineering, radiant intensity is sometimes called radiation intensity.
