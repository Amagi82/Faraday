/**
 * In accelerator physics, rigidity is the effect of particular magnetic fields on the motion of the
 * charged particles.
 *
 * It is a measure of the momentum of the particle, and it refers to the fact that a higher momentum
 * particle will have a higher resistance to deflection by a magnetic field. It is defined as
 * R = Bρ = p/q, where B is the magnetic field, ρ is the gyroradius of the particle due to this field,
 * p is the particle momentum, and q is its charge. It is frequently referred to as simply "Bρ".
