/**
 * Molar concentration (also called molarity, amount concentration or substance concentration) is a
 * measure of the concentration of a chemical species, in particular of a solute in a solution, in
 * terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution. In chemistry, the most commonly used
 * unit for molarity is the number of moles per litre, having the unit symbol mol/L or mol⋅dm−3 in SI
 * unit. A solution with a concentration of 1 mol/L is said to be 1 molar, commonly designated as
 * 1 M. To avoid confusion with SI prefix mega, which has the same abbreviation, small caps ᴍ or
 * italicized M are also used in journals and textbooks.
