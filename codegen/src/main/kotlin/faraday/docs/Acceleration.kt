/**
 * In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to
 * time. Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The
 * orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on
 * that object. The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's Second Law,
 * is the combined effect of two causes:
 * - the net balance of all external forces acting onto that object — magnitude is directly
 *   proportional to this net resulting force;
 * - that object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made — magnitude is
 *   inversely proportional to the object's mass.
 *
 * The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared, m/s^2.
