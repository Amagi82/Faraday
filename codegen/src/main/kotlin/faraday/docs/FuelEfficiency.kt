/**
 * Fuel efficiency is a form of thermal efficiency, meaning the ratio of effort to result of a
 * process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier (fuel) into kinetic
 * energy or work. Overall fuel efficiency may vary per device, which in turn may vary per
 * application, and this spectrum of variance is often illustrated as a continuous energy
 * profile.
