/**
 * In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the magnetic flux (often denoted Φ or ΦB) through
 * a surface is the surface integral of the normal component of the magnetic field flux density
 * B passing through that surface. The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb; in derived units,
 * volt–seconds), and the CGS unit is the maxwell. Magnetic flux is usually measured with a
 * fluxmeter, which contains measuring coils and electronics, that evaluates the change of MagneticFlux
 * in the measuring coils to calculate the measurement of magnetic flux.
