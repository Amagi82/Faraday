/**
 * An electric field surrounds an electric charge, and exerts force on other charges in the field,
 * attracting or repelling them. Electric fields are created by electric charges, or by time-
 * varying magnetic fields. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the
 * electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces (or interactions) of nature.
