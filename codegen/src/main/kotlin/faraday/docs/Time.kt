/**
 * Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently
 * irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future. It is a component
 * quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or
 * the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality
 * or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with
 * three spatial dimensions.
 *
 * Time in physics is operationally defined as "what a clock reads". Time is one of the seven
 * fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International
 * System of Quantities. The SI base unit of time is the second. Time is used to define other
 * quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in
 * circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing
 * a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage
 * of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful
 * in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. To describe
 * observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted.
