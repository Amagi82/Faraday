/**
 * In photography, exposure is the amount of light per unit area (the image plane illuminance
 * times the exposure time) reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic
 * image sensor, as determined by shutter speed, lens aperture, and scene luminance. Exposure is
 * measured in lux seconds, and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance in a
 * specified region.
