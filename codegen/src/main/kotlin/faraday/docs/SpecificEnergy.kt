/**
 * Specific energy or massic energy is energy per unit mass. It is also sometimes called
 * gravimetric energy density, or just energy density though energy density more precisely
 * means energy per unit volume. It is used to quantify, for example, stored heat and other
 * thermodynamic properties of substances such as specific internal energy, specific enthalpy,
 * specific Gibbs free energy, and specific Helmholtz free energy. It may also be used for
 * the kinetic energy or potential energy of a body. Specific energy is an intensive property,
 * whereas energy and mass are extensive properties.
