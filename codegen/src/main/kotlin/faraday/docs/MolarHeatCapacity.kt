/**
 * The molar heat capacity of a chemical substance is the amount of energy that must be added, in
 * the form of heat, to one mole of the substance in order to cause an increase of one unit in its
 * temperature. Alternatively, it is the heat capacity of a sample of the substance divided by the
 * amount of substance of the sample; or also the specific heat capacity of the substance times
 * its molar mass.
