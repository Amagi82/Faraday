/**
 * In solid-state physics, the electron mobility characterises how quickly an electron can move through
 * a metal or semiconductor, when pulled by an electric field. There is an analogous quantity for holes,
 * called hole mobility. The term carrier mobility refers in general to both electron and hole mobility.
 *
 * Electron and hole mobility are special cases of electrical mobility of charged particles in a fluid
 * under an applied electric field.
