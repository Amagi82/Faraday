/**
 * Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration
 * (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. An object's mass also
 * determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
 *
 * The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg). In physics, mass is not the same as weight,
 * even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale,
 * rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses. An object on the Moon
 * would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still
 * have the same mass. This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that
 * (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force.
