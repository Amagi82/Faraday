/**
 * In classical electromagnetism, polarization density (or electric polarization, or simply polarization)
 * is the vector field that expresses the density of permanent or induced electric dipole moments in a
 * dielectric material. When a dielectric is placed in an external electric field, its molecules gain
 * electric dipole moment and the dielectric is said to be polarized. The electric dipole moment induced
 * per unit volume of the dielectric material is called the electric polarization of the dielectric.
