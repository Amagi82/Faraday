/**
 * Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces to shrink into the minimum surface area
 * possible. Surface tension allows insects (e.g. water striders), usually denser than water,
 * to float and slide on a water surface.
 *
 * At liquidâ€“air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid
 * molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion).
