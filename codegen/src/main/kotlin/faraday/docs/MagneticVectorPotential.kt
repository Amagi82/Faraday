/**
 * Magnetic vector potential, A, is the vector quantity in classical electromagnetism defined so that
 * its curl is equal to the magnetic field. Together with the electric potential φ, the magnetic vector
 * potential can be used to specify the electric field E as well. Therefore, many equations of
 * electromagnetism can be written either in terms of the fields E and B, or equivalently in terms of
 * the potentials φ and A. In more advanced theories such as quantum mechanics, most equations use
 * potentials rather than fields.
