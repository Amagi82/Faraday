/**
 * Absorbed dose is a dose quantity which is the measure of the energy deposited in matter
 * by ionizing radiation per unit mass. Absorbed dose is used in the calculation of dose
 * uptake in living tissue in both radiation protection (reduction of harmful effects),
 * and radiology (potential beneficial effects for example in cancer treatment). It is
 * also used to directly compare the effect of radiation on inanimate matter such as in
 * radiation hardening.
 *
 * The SI unit of measure is the gray (Gy), which is defined as one Joule of energy
 * absorbed per kilogram of matter. The older, non-SI CGS unit rad, is sometimes also
 * used, predominantly in the USA.
