/**
 * In physics, angular acceleration refers to the time rate of change of angular velocity.
 * As there are two types of angular velocity, namely spin angular velocity and orbital
 * angular velocity, there are naturally also two types of angular acceleration, called
 * spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration respectively. Spin angular
 * acceleration refers to the angular acceleration of a rigid body about its centre of
 * rotation, and orbital angular acceleration refers to the angular acceleration of a point
 * particle about a fixed origin.
