/**
 * The thermal conductivity of a material is a measure of its ability to conduct heat. It is
 * commonly denoted by k, λ, or κ.
 *
 * Heat transfer occurs at a lower rate in materials of low thermal conductivity than in materials
 * of high thermal conductivity. For instance, metals typically have high thermal conductivity and
 * are very efficient at conducting heat, while the opposite is true for insulating materials like
 * Styrofoam. Correspondingly, materials of high thermal conductivity are widely used in heat sink
 * applications, and materials of low thermal conductivity are used as thermal insulation. The
 * reciprocal of thermal conductivity is called thermal resistivity.
