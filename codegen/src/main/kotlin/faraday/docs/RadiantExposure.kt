/**
 * In radiometry, radiant exposure or fluence is the radiant energy received by a surface per unit
 * area, or equivalently the irradiance of a surface, integrated over time of irradiation, and
 * spectral exposure is the radiant exposure per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether
 * the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength.
