/**
 * Power density is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume.
 *
 * In energy transformers including batteries, fuel cells, motors, etc., and also power supply units
 * or similar, power density refers to a volume. It is then also called volume power density, which
 * is expressed as W/m3.
 *
 * In reciprocating internal combustion engines, power density—power per swept volume or brake
 * horsepower per cubic centimeter —is an important metric. This is based on the internal capacity
 * of the engine, not its external size.
