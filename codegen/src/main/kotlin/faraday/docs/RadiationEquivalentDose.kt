/**
 * Equivalent dose is a dose quantity H representing the stochastic health effects of low levels
 * of ionizing radiation on the human body which represents the probability of radiation-induced
 * cancer and genetic damage. It is derived from the physical quantity absorbed dose, but also
 * takes into account the biological effectiveness of the radiation, which is dependent on the
 * radiation type and energy. In the SI system of units, the unit of measure is the sievert (Sv).
