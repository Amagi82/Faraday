/**
 * Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape or planar lamina,
 * in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object.
 * Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to
 * fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat.
 * It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of
 * a solid (a three-dimensional concept).
 *
 * The area of a shape can be measured by comparing the shape to squares of a fixed size. In the
 * International System of Units (SI), the standard unit of area is the square metre (written as m2),
 * which is the area of a square whose sides are one metre long. A shape with an area of three square
 * metres would have the same area as three such squares. In mathematics, the unit square is defined to
 * have area one, and the area of any other shape or surface is a dimensionless real number.
