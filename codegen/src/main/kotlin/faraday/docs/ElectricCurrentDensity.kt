/**
 * In electromagnetism, current density is the amount of charge per unit time that flows through
 * a unit area of a chosen cross section. The current density vector is defined as a vector whose
 * magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area at a given point in space, its
 * direction being that of the motion of the positive charges at this point. In SI base units,
 * the electric current density is measured in amperes per square metre.
