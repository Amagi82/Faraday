/**
 * Radiation exposure is a measure of the ionization of air due to ionizing radiation from photons;
 * that is, gamma rays and X-rays.[1] It is defined as the electric charge freed by such radiation
 * in a specified volume of air divided by the mass of that air.
 *
 * The SI unit of exposure is the coulomb per kilogram (C/kg), which has largely replaced the roentgen (R).
 *
 * As a measure of radiation damage exposure has been superseded by the concept of absorbed dose which
 * takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material.
