/**
 * In Newtonian mechanics, linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply momentum
 * (pl. momenta) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector
 * quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If m is an object's mass and v is
 * its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum is: p = mv
